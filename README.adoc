= Embedded Programming using the GNU Toolchain

This is a short tutorial on using the GNU toolchain for bare metal
programming. The tutorial uses Qemu to simulate an ARM board, and
provides instructions to test programs within the simulated
machine. The following topics will be covered.

  * Writing assembly language programs
  * Using make for build automation
  * Writing linker scripts
  * Writing C Startup code
  * Using the C library
  * Inline Assembler

The tutorial is written in asciidoc. The asciidoc source is converted
to DocBook and then rendered to HTML.

The instructions to build the documentation on Debian Jessie is given
below.

------
# apt-get install openjdk-7-jre libsaxon-java libxslthl-java docbookxsl asciidoc imgsizer dia
$ make
------

For Ubuntu 18.05, the package names are slightly different, but the make
command is the same:
------
# apt-get install openjdk-8-jre libsaxon-java libxslthl-java docbook-xsl asciidoc imgsizer dia
$ make
------
